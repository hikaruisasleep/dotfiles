# hikaru's desktops

just a collection of my unix desktop settings

---

apps used:
```
i3-gaps picom-git rofi polybar feh
kitty zsh oh-my-zsh bunnyfetch
```
theme is either nord or tokyonight depending on my mood

---

not updated regularly, some stuff are tailor-made to my setup and my needs so don't ask me for help if something breaks on your system
